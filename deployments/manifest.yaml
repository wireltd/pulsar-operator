                      This may be any object from a non-empty API group (non core
                      object) or a PersistentVolumeClaim object. When this field is
                      specified, volume binding will only succeed if the type of the
                      specified object matches some installed volume populator or
                      dynamic provisioner. This field will replace the functionality
                      of the dataSource field and as such if both fields are non-empty,
                      they must have the same value. For backwards compatibility,
                      when namespace isn''t specified in dataSourceRef, both fields
                      (dataSource and dataSourceRef) will be set to the same value

                      set to the same value and must be empty. There are three important
                      differences between dataSource and dataSourceRef: * While dataSource
                      only allows two specific types of objects, dataSourceRef allows
                      any non-core object, as well as PersistentVolumeClaim objects.
                      * While dataSource ignores disallowed values (dropping them),
                      dataSourceRef preserves all values, and generates an error if
                      a disallowed value is specified. * While dataSource only allows
                      local objects, dataSourceRef allows objects in any namespaces.
                      (Beta) Using this field requires the AnyVolumeDataSource feature
                      gate to be enabled. (Alpha) Using the namespace field of dataSourceRef
